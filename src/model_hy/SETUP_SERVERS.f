C
C   INPUT ARGUMENT LIST:
C     NPES_MOD - NUMBER OF MPI TASKS FOR MODEL INTEGRATION FROM INPES AND JNPES
C                THIS IS THE NUMBER OF MPI TASKS THE EXECUTABLE HAS BEEN BUILT FOR.
C                NPES, RETURNED FROM MPI_COMM_SIZE, MUST BE AT LEAST THIS SIZE
C                OTHERWISE THE INTEGRATION CANNOT PROCEED. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
C                NPES_MOD AND NPES IS THE NUMBER OF MPI TASKS THAT ARE AVAILABLE
C                FOR I/O SERVING. THIS CAN BE ZERO, IN WHICH CASE CHKOUT WILL
C                WRITE A DIRECT ACCESS FILE THAT CAN BE SEPARTELY "QUILTED". 
C                IN ORDER TO SKIP THE SEPARATE QUILTING STEP, MAKE SURE THAT
C                THE NUMBER OF MPI TASKS THAT THE CODE IS INITIATED WITH IS AT
C                LEAST ONE GREATER THAN NPES_MOD.
C
C   OUTPUT ARGUMENT LIST:
C     NPES - NUMBER OF MPI TASKS FOR MODEL INTEGRATION
C     MYPE - MY RANK
C     IQUILT_GROUP - NUMBER OF I/O SERVER GROUPS
C     INUMQ - ARRAY THAT HOLDS THE NUMBER OF SERVERS IN EACH GROUP
C     NPES - NUMBER OF MPI TASKS FOR MODEL INTEGRATION
C     MPI_COMM_COMP - THE NEW INTRACOMMUNICATOR FOR ALL TASKS
C     MPI_COMM_INTER - THE INTERCOMMUNICATOR FOR THE I/O SERVERS
C     MPI_COMM_INTER_ARRAY - THE ARRAY OF INTERCOMMUNICATORS FOR THE INTEGRATION TASKS
C
C   INPUT FILES:  NONE
C
C   OUTPUT FILES:  
C         NONE BUT THE CODE DOES ATTEMPT TO READ THE ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE "SERVER_GROUPS".
C          THIS IS THE NUMBER OF INDEPENDENT GROUPS OF SERVER TASKS. THE DEFAULT IS ONE
C          AND SHOULD BE OK FOR MOST APPLICATIONS OF THE ETA CODE. IF ONE SET OF I/O
C          SERVERS CAN NOT COMPLETE BEFORE THE NEXT OUPUT TIME THEN ADDITIONAL I/O SERVER
C          GROUPS WOULD BE USEFUL.

C     AT THIS POINT WE HAVE A NEW COMMUNICATOR, MPI_COMM_COMP,
C     THAT CAN BE USED BY THE FORECASTS TASKS AND THE I/O SERVER TASKS
C     FOR THEIR INTERNAL COMMUNICATIONS. ONTO THE INTERCOMMUNICATORS ...
C
C     NOW WE MUST CREATE THE INTERCOMMUNICATORS FOR USE BETWEEN THE MPI
C     TASKS DOING THE MODEL INTEGRATION AND THE MPI TASKS FOR EACH 
C     SERVER GROUP. THE FIRST STEP IS TO EXCLUDE THE TASKS THAT DONT
C     BELONG. WE WILL DO THIS FOR EACH SERVER GROUP BY EXCLUDING THE TASKS
C     FROM ALL OF THE OTHER SERVER GROUPS.
C
      allocate ( irank ( iqserver ) )

C     THIS IS THE FIRST POSSIBLE TASK ID THAT COULD BE EXCLUDED
      do jj = 1, iquilt_group

      end do
C
C     AT THIS POINT WE HAVE AN ARRAY, IRANK, WITH TASK IDS TO EXCLUDE
C     THERE ARE ICC OF THEM.
C     CREATE A NEW GROUP WITH THE TASKS FROM THE OTHER SERVER GROUPS
C     EXCLUDED AND THEN CREATE A NEW COMMUNICATOR ( IWORLD_MINUS ) THAT
C     CONTAINS ONLY THE MPI TASKS DOING THE MODEL INTEGRATION AND THE
C     TASKS THAT BLONG TO THE SERVER GROUP WE ARE CONSIDERING.
C   
      iworld = MPI_COMM_WORLD

      call mpi_group_free(igroup,ierr)
      call mpi_group_free(igroup_x,ierr)
C
C     AT THIS POINT WE HAVE A COMMUNICATOR THAT EXCLUDES THE TASKS WE DONT WANT.
C     CREATE AN INTERCOMMUNICATOR FOR USE BETWEEN THE MPI TASKS DOING THE MODEL
C     INTEGRATION AND THE I/O SERVER GROUP WE ARE CONSIDERING. THIS PROCESS IS
C     A COLLECTIVE ROUTINE SO IT CAN ONLY BE DONE BY THE TASKS THAT HAVE NOT 
C     BEEN EXCLUDED. SAVE THIS NEW COMMUNICATOR IN MPI_COMM_INTER FOR USE BY
C     THE TASKS THAT BELONG TO THE SERVER GROUP THAT WE ARE CONSIDERING. THE
C     TASKS THAT ARE PERFORMING THE MODEL INTEGRATION WILL REFERENCE
C     MPI_COMM_INTER_ARRAY() SINCE WE WILL NEED TO SELECT WHICH SERVER
C     GROUP WE WISH TO COMMUNICATE WITH.
